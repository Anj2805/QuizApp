Interactive Quiz App

Here's a basic structure of an Interactive Quiz App using JavaScript and DOM manipulation:

Features:
->  Dynamic Content Update: Load new questions and answers from an array or API and display them dynamically.
->  Event Listeners: Handle click events for answers, navigation buttons (next/previous), and a submit button.
->  Form Handling: Add validation to ensure the user selects an answer before moving to the next question.
->  Timers: Implement a timer to make the quiz more engaging, which also helps in manipulating DOM elements like countdowns.
->  Scoring System: Display real-time feedback after each question and show the final score at the end.
-> Animations: Highlight the correct/wrong answer by adding/removing CSS classes.

Additional DOM topics you will practice:
->  DOM traversal (accessing elements by id, class, querySelector).
->  Updating text content and attributes.
->  Handling form inputs and buttons.
->  Manipulating styles dynamically.
